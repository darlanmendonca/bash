Do you liked the content and want contribute? We'd love your help, well we can build a content really relevant, useful to beginners, and for us, that we are always learning more.

Our targt is list things so

Didactic and examples help to understand, what is the most important.
Activities help to fix the content in mind :D.

### How contribute

To facilitate contributions and revisions, we need organize us. Together we define some process to contribute easily and avoid possible errors.

1. Fork the project
2. Create a branch, to add your contribution
3. Do only one type of contribution at a time
4. Make a pull request

For one type only mean, avoid adding many commands at once. E.g., I will contribute with the new commands ```rm```, and ```mv```. So should be two pull requests, and not only one. This also facilitates the code review, will avoid conflicts, and facilitate needed corrections.

### Organization

When you will add a new command, create a file markdown, i.e. ```rm.md```, and in this file, talk about it.
In ```Readme.md``` we list only the commands really basics/essentials to who is beginner.
After commands, are listed in ```summary.md``` file, and sorted alphabetically. 

### Organização

Quando for adicionar um novo comando, crie um arquivo markdown, exemplo ```rm.md```, e em tal arquivo, aborde o mesmo.
No ```Readme.md``` listamos apenas os comando realmente básicos/essenciais para quem está começando. 
Demais comandos, são listados no arquivo ```summary.md```, e ordenados em ordem alfabética.

That is, when you contribute with a new command

1. Create a file for the same, i.e. ```rm.md```.
2. Add a link for the same in ```summary.md```, sorted by alphabet.
3. Or add in ```Readme.md``` if is really basic/essential.
